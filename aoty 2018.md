### Top ten

**Manor of Infinite Forms** (*Tomb mold*)  

**Conqueror's Oath** (*Visigoth*)  
Tight, soaring trad-speed. Choice riff: main riff of Warrior Queen (tr. 2)  

**White Horse Hill** (*Solstice*)  
In the year 2019, 'epic' as a descriptor is trite to say the least, but it suits Solstice.  

**Terminal** (*Bongripper*)  
  
**Mishlei** (*Mizmor*)  

**Desolation** (*Khemmis*)  

**Open Season** (*Mi\'gauss*)  
A re-release from 2003, Open Season is an incredible showcase of midpace death metal, clean and strong in sound but not overproduced.  
Choice riffs: Akumon (tr. 6) :18; Meshpeshawa Poc (tr. 2) intro.  

**s/t** (*Sorcier des Glaces*)

**Esoteric Malacology** (*Slugdge*)  
Leaving aside another A+ round of slug-adjacent song titles, a crushing, nearly plodding technical death metal album to lose oneself in.

**Letters from the Edge** (*Sear Bliss*)

### Honorable Mention
**Firepower** (*Judas Priest*)  
Incredibly, Halford sounds amazing on his 18th full-length album with JP. This album took a while to grow on me, and as such nearly didn't make the list, but it's an excellent listen.
