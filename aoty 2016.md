**Jumalten Aika** (*Moonsorrow*)  
Jumalten Aika was supposed to be--paraphrasing-- a return for Moonsorrow to earlier form, with better production. I was excited, but cautious; I love their first 4 albums, vary as they do between supremely patient, almost ambient swell and fall, bleak melody, and plodding riffing, but reaching back 15 years is quite a feat for any band. Yet the album largely delivered. It’s Moonsorrow down to the ground: alternately harsh and plodding, bombastic, soft and acoustic-instrumented.

**Terminal Redux** (*Vektor*)  
Vektor went in a lot of different directions on this album. There are downright mellow interludes, and one of my favorite tracks-- Collapse-- is as much prog as thrash.  There’s a lot going on song to song in a way that keeps the intricacies of their technical ability from getting boring or impenetrable.  

**Hunted** (*Khemmis*)  
Warm, fuzzy doom, and a vocalist with a downright pretty voice. Hunted is interesting and catchy from one end to the other and a really nice break from harsher music.

**Stand in the Fire** (*Striker*)  
Screaming guitars and soaring vocals are admittedly a soft spot of mine, this album is that in spades, and sits in my road trip playlist for the foreseeable future. Striker edge right up against power metal in the vein of old Hibria on a few tracks, putting it up front and center with Phoenix Lights.

*Inquisition* since outed as child abusing scum had a spot here; fuck them.

**Drengskapr** (*Panphage*)  
There’s much atmosphere in this album: Reverby, almost howled vocals, lo-fi uptempo black metal styling and occasional bursts of melody and backing vocals make for an album that’s at once energetic,  wistful, and faraway.

**Starspawn** (*Blood Incantation*)
I honestly didn’t expect to like this as much as I did, but Blood Incantation do great work layering a foundation of powerful, otherworldly murk with midpace riffing and the odd screaming solo. Opening with a 13 minute song is maybe ambitious but this is still one of the few death metal albums I’ve really enjoyed this year.

**Le Dernier crepuscule** (*Chthe’ilist*)  
To describe the feel of Le Dernier in a word I might pick ‘sinister’, or ‘foreboding’’. The vocals almost drip (with something Lovecraftian, no doubt) and while technically jam packed, atmospheric touches like choir vocals and ambient sounds add a lot to the feel Chthe’ilist seem to be going for.

**Winter’s Gate** (*Insomnium*)  
In stark contrast to a lot of the other albums on this list, Winter’s Gate is bombastic, highly produced, layered and re-layered. It’s also beautiful and slightly melancholy, and unlike a lot of similar melodic death metal it manages not to sound sterile or lifeless. Strictly speaking 1 forty minute track, it reminds me a lot of Edge of Sanity’s Crimson II down to being surprised that one track works out so well. I appreciate it in sort of the same way I appreciate a good concept album.

**Empty Space Meditation** (*Urfaust*)  
Bleak, wailing, to use a cliche, ice cold atmospheric black metal. Dissonant midpace interludes and sharp synths shift the feel from ‘frozen north’ to ‘otherworldly’ to possibly subterranean. Overall a mesmerizing album. 

### Honorable Mentions
**Hardwired… to Self Destruct** (*Metallica*)  
Honestly, Metallica surprised me, and indeed I think a lot of people. Hardwired has a pretty good sound and some fun, catchy riffs (Moth into Flame and Spit Out the Bone stand out) In the way of superstars though, it really needs an editor: of 12 songs only 1 is under 5 minutes, and almost all of them are over 6. *n.b., in the time isnce writing this album has quite grown on me*

**The Uncanny Valley** (*Perturbator*)  
I’m honestly not very equipped to analyze electronic music at this point, but I dig this; not as consistently great as Dangerous Days, but Perturbator’s lush, sinister style continues to do it for me.
