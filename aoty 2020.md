## Albums
**Blood Red Victory** (*Ironflame*, power) https://ironflame.bandcamp.com/album/blood-red-victory  
Fantastic soaring power metal. AOTY unquestionably.  
**The Affair of the Poisons** (*Hellripper*, black/speed)   https://peaceville.bandcamp.com/album/the-affair-of-the-poisons  
 1 man outfit, excellent mixture of black and speed metal; catchy as hell.  
**Reflections** (*Godthrymm*, doom) https://profoundlorerecords.bandcamp.com/album/reflections  
Managing to pull of the slow epic doom style without being boring. Gloomy, crushing, with the vocalist paying pretty amazing homage to Candlemass in parts and doing a great job in general.      
**Black Tides of Obscurity** (*Earth Rot*, death)   https://earthrot.com.au/album/black-tides-of-obscurity
The rare death metal album that grabs me--ironic since there are 2 on this list-- but this plodding bombastic album is one of the sounds that often does.   
**No Dawn for Men** (*Feminazgul*, black)   https://feminazgul.bandcamp.com/album/no-dawn-for-men
Echoing, ebb and flow atmospheric black metal interspersed with beautiful interludes of piano and synth.   
**Detritus of the Final Age** (*Harlott*, thrash)   https://harlottmetal.bandcamp.com/album/detritus-of-the-final-age  
 Solid thrash; some songs meander a bit but a good listen overall. Not revolutionary but catchy and fun.  
**Sulfuric Disintegration** (*OF FEATHER AND BONE*, death)   https://offeatherandbone666.bandcamp.com/album/sulfuric-disintegration  
Driving, frantic. Reminds me of Nile.  
**A Romance with Violence** (*Wayfarer*, black)   https://wayfarercolorado.bandcamp.com/album/a-romance-with-violence  
Rips. Oozes spaghetti western atmosphere.    
**Enlightened in Eternity** (*Spirits Adrift*, trad/doom)   https://listen.20buckspin.com/album/enlightened-in-eternity  
Spirits Adrift are becoming, for me, one of those bands that have a sound dialed in and iterate on it each album. If you like previous SA releases or the riffy interface of trad and doom metal this is great.  
**Termination Shock** (*Traveler*, trad/speed)   https://travelermetal.bandcamp.com/album/termination-shock  
The kind of upbeat headbanging trad I really enjoy.    

## EPs
**s/t** (*EXSUL*, death)   https://exsul.bandcamp.com/album/exsul  
 Muddy, echoing, great balance of plodding and frantic.  
**Speed Armageddon** (*Wraith/Bastardizer*, speed)   https://wraith219.bandcamp.com/album/speed-armageddon-split-w-bastardizer / https://bastardizer.bandcamp.com/album/speed-armageddon (split)  
Fun, grimy speed metal  

## Thoughts
Harder list to get together than most years; my top 3-5 have been in the bag for months but filling the list out took a lot of listening and thinking.
