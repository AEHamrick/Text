## Thoughts
It was a good fucking year for power metal; besides Gloryhammer and Paladin in my top ten, Bloodbound, Twilight Force, Frozen Crown, and Skelator all dropped solid, fun, interesting albums. Also plenty of solid speed & thrash (Mystic, Toxic Holocaust, High Command)  

Death metal remains a genre I only intermittently 'get', with the latest from Tomb Mold, Blood Incantation and Cattle Decapitation 
falling squarely in the realm of 'interesting but not moving', although in fairness I did really enjoy Tomb Mold's previous album.  

Disappointing AotY: Borknagar - True North. Meh.
