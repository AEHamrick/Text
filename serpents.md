#Venomous snakes; avoiding mistakes
(sorry)

##Coral snakes: the really easy ones
North American coral snakes (*Micrurus* and *Micruroides* sp.) and their lookalikes
have a handy--though varied--mnemonic of the form:  
>red on yellow kill a fellow \<or other rhyming implication of death\>;   
red on black venom lack \<or likewise rhyming but similarly less death\>

And indeed--
Eastern coral snake (*Micrurus fulvius*)- red on yellow
![eastern_coral] 

And one of its several lookalikes, the (harmless) scarlet kingsnake (*Lampropeltis elapsoides*), red on black
![scarlet_king]

That's it (within North America.)

##The rest: Still not too hard, mostly
####Head shape 1: folklore that's actually pretty right...
With a few exceptions, the old saying that venomous snakes have distinctly triangular, spear, spade, or shovel shaped heads
is pretty accurate, although it does rely on getting a good look at the snake's head.   
Contrast the black ratsnake (nonvenomous)  
![black_ratsnake]
and the garter snake (nonvenomous)
![garter]  
With these juvenile and adult copperheads (venomous)  
 ![copperhead]  
 and this juvenile southern pacific rattlesnake  
 ![s_p_rattlesnake]  
 and the cottonmouth  
 ![cottonmouth]  

####Head shape 2: ...except when it's not
The head shape "rule" notably breaks down with our friends the watersnakes, *Nerodia* sp.: Heavy bodied, variably colored, 
brown on brown-and can flatten their heads out to appear larger
![nerodia_sipeodon]
A layperson could easily be forgiven for deciding that's a "triangular" head shape, or that it's heavy bodied enough to 
be a copperhead or cottonmouth.  

Too, young black ratsnakes and black racers look like shoestring with heads, and can
flatten their heads defensively; while they don't too closely resemble our venomous species, if head shape is the only 
diagnostic tool we have then without experience, confusion might occur.  

Confusing young ratsnakes and racers with copperheads is the most common case of mistaken identity in the writer's amateur experience--
Ratsnake (exhibiting head flattening posture)
![juvenile_ratsnake]
Racer  
![juvenile_racer]    
Copperhead (again)  
![copperhead_2] 
(and again)
![copperhead_3]
Despite the copperhead species being rather variable in patterning, looking for dark "hershey kisses" shapes on lighter background 
along its sides as opposed to the dorsal blotching both racer and ratsnake hatchlings exhibit, and the blotching-banding 
we saw in the watersnake earlier
