### Top ten

**Mirror Reaper** (*Bell Witch*)  
Funeral doom at once haunting and soothing  

**Nordkarpatenland** (*Malokarpatan*)  
Catchy, cavernous Slovak black n roll; whiff of fun folk in the interludes and song titles  

**Immersion Trench Reverie** (*Yellow Eyes*)  
Frantic, jangling, and eerie  

**Kelle Surut Soi** (*Havukruunu*)  
Bombastic, expansive  

**Unhallowed Blood Oath** (*Runespell*)  
Bathory-esque in the best ways: sometimes cold, soaring, and plodding  

**s/t** (*Orm*)  
Catchy, headbanging black metal; intense wall of sound interludes  

**Left Hand Pass** (*Cannabis Corpse*)  
Better than a weed joke band has any right to be. Great sound, great riffs, great puns  

**demo** (*Starcave*)  
Restrained, almost sparse. Droning guitar with bass and synth forward in parts. Vocals echoing behind the instruments  

**Elegies of the Stellar Wind** (*Evilfeast*)  
Synthy, dramatic, echoing; reminiscent of Windir & early Dimmu Borgir  

**Eroded Corridors of Unbeing** (*Spectral Voice*)  
“Crushing” as a death/doom adjective is overused, but it fits. Gorgeous melodic interludes  

### Honorable Mentions

Secrets Of The Magick Grimoire (*Elvenking*)  
Huge soft spot for Elvenking; lush, fun album  

**Coagulating Darkness** (*Hellripper*)  
Rough around the edges, amazing effort for a 1 person outfit
